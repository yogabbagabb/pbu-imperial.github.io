# The Details
{: .fill-blue .wide-block .right }

The ***Student Union***{: .fancy } represents us (students at Imperial). We elect a Union Council in annual elections, which votes on the Union's stances and actions. **The councillors work for us**, and it's their job to listen to the students they represent.

Now is the time for ***your***{: .fancy } representatives to step up and vote for **100% plant-based catering**{: .headingy .yellow } on campus. 
{: .middle-block .fill-green }

We need campaigners to ask their representatives to be at the **Sustainability Forum** on 30<sup>th</sup> January and at the **Union Council meeting** on 4<sup>th</sup> February.
