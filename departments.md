# What next?
{: .fill-blue .wide-block .right }

Now we need to actually implement **100% plant-based catering**{: .headingy .yellow }. We're breaking up into departmental campaigns to make change, while keeping presure up on the university as a whole.

We need people to start campaigns in their departments. Contact us at **pbu@ic.ac.uk**{: .red } and we can put your in contact with your campaign or help you start a new one.
